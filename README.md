# ChallengeMarvel
App made for a coding challenge. It retrieves information from the Marvel Api about Heroes and Comics.


Current stack: MVVM, LiveData, Flow, Coroutines, Retrofit, OkHttp, Paging3, Glide, DataBinding, ViewBinding, Navigation Component, Koin.

Note: I was requested to show only future events in the Events tab, but there was only 1 future event, so i left all past events in order to show the recycler view with more than 1 item in it.
